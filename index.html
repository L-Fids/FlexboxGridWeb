                        Basic Zombie hates the term "Basic". 
                        He doesn't consider himself some generic foe or 
                        common corpse. He's an individual, darn it, and 
                        he's going to make a difference even if it kills you.</p>

                        His traffic cone headpiece makes him twice as tough as normal zombies.
                        After a wild night, Conehead Zombie woke up holding a mysterious receipt 
                        for a cone and industrial strength adhesive.</p>

                        There was a time when Buckethead Zombie was hailed as a 
                        zombie genius for his innovative bucket-on-head strategy. 
                        It's been a few years, though, and zombies wonder if he's 
                        got any surprises left. His secret? He doesn't.</p>

                        A spelling impaired zombie named "Brian," Flag Zombie keeps 
                        thinking the rest of the zombies are talking to him. At least he feels important.</p>
