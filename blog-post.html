                        This recipe is the workhorse in your bread stable.
                        If you learn to make this properly and consistently, branching off into other varieties of bread
                        will be easy and natural.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-post-text">
                        Flour, water, salt and a levain (AKA a leavening agent) are all you need to get this recipe going.
                        The following proportion of ingredients will render you two smaller sized loaves. Perfect for an individual or small family.

                        <ol class="instruction">
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Feed your starter:</span> 24 hours after your previous feeding, discard all but 50 grams. Add 100 grams all purpose flour and 50 grams whole wheat.
                                Mix until incorporated and let rest for 6-8 hours.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Autolyse:</span> After your starter rests, mix the 604 grams white and 276 grams whole wheat flour with
                                684 grams water in a stand mixer just until incorporated. Be careful not to overmix at this point. Cover and let rest for 20-30 minutes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Mix final dough:</span> In the stand mixer bowl, sprinkle 22 grams salt over the top of the dough. Measure out 216 grams of starter into a separate bowl. Transfer
                                measured out starter into stand mixer bowl with a spatula. Mix for 90 seconds at low speed. Transfer to large bowl for bulk fermentation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Folding and bulk fermentation:</span> This dough requires 4 - 6 folds during bulk fermentation. Aim to perform the first fold about 20 minutes after mixing with
                                a 20 minute gap between the next two folds. Folds 4 - 6 can be done 30 minutes apart. After the final fold, let dough rest until at least doubled in size,
                                approx 4 - 6 hours depending on room temperature. If room temp is too cool (less than 20C), dough can be placed in oven with oven light on to increase fermentation temperature.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Divide:</span> Sprinkle flour around the edges of the dough. With a spatula, gently ease out the dough onto a floured work surface, ensuring the dough does not tear.
                                With a dough cutter, cut the dough in half. It helps here to have floured hands and access to a shallow bowl of water into which you can dip the dough cutter as the dough will
                                be sticky.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Shape:</span> With a floured non-dominant hand and dough cutter in your dominant hand, shape each dough into a ball. Let rest for 5 minutes.
                                Though this next step is not necessary I have found it helps with gas retention. Do a final shape by flipping the dough and folding it in half and repeat the process of forming
                                the dough into a medium-tight ball. Let rest for 5 minutes again. Place the shaped doughs, seam side up, into pre-floured proofing bowls.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Proof:</span> Place proofing bowls in individual plastic bags and then place in fridge to let proof for 12 hours.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Bake Prep:</span> Place dutch oven(s) in the oven and preheat to 500F. Once the oven has reached 500F, let the dutch ovens
                                continue to heat in the oven for at least another 30 minutes. You want those dutch ovens nice and hot.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Bake:</span> Pull your doughs out of the fridge. Cut two parchment papers the width of the dutch ovens. Gently overturn
                                your doughs onto the parchment paper. With a razor, score the top of your bread with two clean slices approx 2 cm in depth. This will help ensure the gases built
                                up in your dough escape upwards and loft your bread upward rather than sideways. Take out the dutch ovens and from the oven and carefully lower the doughs into
                                the dutch ovens with mitted hands. Mist the tops of the doughs with water. Bake for 15 mins at 500F. Lower temp to 450F and bake for 15 more mins. Remove lid and
                                bake for another 15-20 minutes until bread is golden brown.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <span class="strong-text">Cool:</span> Your bread is baked and now all you have to do is let it cool for 1-2 hours on a cooling rack.
                            </li>
